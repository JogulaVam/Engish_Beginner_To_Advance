## NOUN

### What is a Noun?
A noun is a word that names a person, place, thing, or idea. It's often called a "naming word."

### Why do we use Nouns?
Nouns are essential because they identify what we are talking about. They act as the main subject or an object in a sentence. Without nouns, we wouldn't know who is doing what action or who is being affected.

### What are the types of Nouns?

#### -> Common Noun
The general name for a person, place, or thing (e.g., city, car, student).

**Examples:**
*   The **dog** barked loudly in the **park**.
*   She placed the **book** on the **table**.
*   The **teacher** explained the **lesson** clearly.
*   We visited a beautiful **city** during our **vacation**.
*   The **car** stopped at the **traffic signal**.
