## Pronoun

### What is a Pronoun?
A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun or another pronoun. Instead of repeating a noun, we can use a pronoun to make sentences smoother and avoid redundancy.

### Why do we use Pronouns?
To avoid repetition, and to make communication smoother and faster, we use pronouns.

### What are the types of Pronouns?

#### -> Personal Pronoun
Refers to a specific person or thing. They change based on person (1st, 2nd, 3rd) and number (singular/plural). (e.g., I, You, He, She, It, They, etc.)
