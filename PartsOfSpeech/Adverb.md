## Adverb

### What is an Adverb?
An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, an adjective, another adverb, or even an entire sentence. Adverbs typically answer questions like *how?*, *when?*, *where?*, *why?*, *to what extent?*, or *under what condition?* Many adverbs end in "-ly," but not all.

### Why do we use Adverbs?
Adverbs add detail and precision to our sentences. They help us paint a clearer picture of actions, descriptions, or other adverbs by providing specific information about the manner, time, place, frequency, or degree of something.
