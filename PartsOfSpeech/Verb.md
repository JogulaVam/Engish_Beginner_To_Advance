## Verb

### What is a Verb?
A verb is a word that describes an action, state, or occurrence. It's the central part of a sentence and tells us what the subject is doing or what state it is in. Verbs are essential for expressing activity and existence.

### Why do we use Verbs?
Verbs are crucial because they provide movement and meaning to sentences. They show action, indicate a state of being, or link the subject to a description. Without verbs, sentences would be incomplete and lack purpose.

### What are the types of Verbs?

#### -> Action Verb
An action verb expresses a physical or mental action performed by the subject.

**Examples:**
*   She **runs** every morning. (physical action)
*   He **thinks** about his future. (mental action)
*   The birds **sing** beautifully. (physical action)
*   I **believe** in you. (mental action)
*   They **played** football yesterday. (physical action)

*   The dog barked loudly at the mailman.
*   She wrote a letter to her grandmother.
*   He climbed the tall mountain.
*   The students studied for their exam.
*   We visited the museum last week.

#### -> Linking Verb
A linking verb connects the subject of a sentence to a noun, pronoun, or adjective that describes or renames the subject. It doesn't show action but rather a state of being. (e.g., is, am, are, was, were, become, seem, look, feel, taste, sound, smell, grow, remain, appear).

**Examples:**
*   She **is** a doctor. (links 'She' to 'doctor')
*   The soup **tastes** delicious. (links 'soup' to 'delicious')
*   He **became** a successful artist. (links 'He' to 'artist')
*   They **are** happy. (links 'They' to 'happy')
*   The sky **looks** cloudy. (links 'sky' to 'cloudy')

*   The flowers smell sweet.

#### -> Helping/Auxiliary Verb
A helping verb (also known as an auxiliary verb) assists the main verb in expressing tense, mood, or voice. They often come before the main verb. (e.g., be, do, have, can, could, will, would, shall, should, may, might, must).

**Examples:**
*   I **am** reading a book. (main verb: reading)
*   She **has** finished her homework. (main verb: finished)
*   They **will** arrive soon. (main verb: arrive)
*   He **can** swim very fast. (main verb: swim)

*   You must complete the task.
*   We could go to the concert.

*   They **eat** dinner. ('dinner' is the direct object)
